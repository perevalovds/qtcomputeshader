# qtcomputeshader
Minimalistic example of using compute shader in Qt without graphical rendering.

The compute shader processes array of 23 floats and Qt reads it back and print to console. :)


### Requirements

* OpenGL >= 4.3.
* Qt >= 5.14.

Code was tested on Windows, but contains no platform-specific code.

### Credits
The code is made using ideas from the following codes:
* Qt "cube" example
* https://forum.qt.io/topic/104448/about-buffer-for-compute-shader/6
